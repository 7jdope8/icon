[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Jump To[/B][/COLOR]
[I]You will notice in 'personal' lists in Fen i.e. your Trakt lists, Fen Favourites or Subscriptions, your Kodi Library etc, There will often be a 'Jump To...' icon at the beginning of the list. This allows you to Jump To a certain page of content within that list, or Jump To media in the list starting with a chosen letter of the alphabet. This is to help with navigating large lists without having to go page to page. You can change the behavior of Jump To by going to Settings->General->Jump To...List Navigation and choosing Alphabet or Page, or bringing up the context menu when Jump To is highlighted and choosing 'Switch Jump To Action'.
