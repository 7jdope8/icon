[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Add/Remove Function[/B][/COLOR]
[I]In Fen there is an Add/Remove context menu item for Movies and TV Shows. This is where you can add/remove a Movie or TV Show to Fen Favorites, Subscriptions or a Trakt list. The remove option has a couple more choices, namely 'Remove from cache', which will update any info for the chosen Movie or TV Show, and 'Remove Fen/Trakt Watched Sync', which will force a resync of Trakt watched items to the Fen watched items database.
