[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Alternate Scraper Modules[/B][/COLOR]
[I]Don't like the scrapers that come with Fen (via Tikiscrapers)? You can go to Tikiscraper settings and import scrapers from another module. Any Exodus style scraper modules can be imported. You can access Tikiscraper's settings via Fen by navigating to Settings->Open Tiki Scraper Settings and then from tikiscraper settings you can import another scraper module to use.
[COLOR red][B]Warning:[/B] This function will copy relevant files on your system and for some modules it will delete copied files it does not need. Any time a program is deleting files/folders on your system there is a risk of something going wrong and possibly something being deleted that shouldn't be. Use this feature at your own risk.[/COLOR][/I]
